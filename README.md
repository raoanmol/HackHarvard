# HackHarvard

Key Idea: Providing direct resources to people currently in weather disasters and storms. 

# Key features:
- Using google maps to direct you to your nearest local shelther, foods banks, mosques, etc
- ability to alert 
- Scrape news sources for real time tracking
- **Big problem**, How can we cater to those with no Wifi? How can we provide general tips & resources to those in different enviornments?
